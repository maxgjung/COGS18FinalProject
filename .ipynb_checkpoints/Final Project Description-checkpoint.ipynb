    "## __Description__\n",
    "For my final project, I set out to make a web scraper that takes different user preferences and can find applicable clothing options from a particular store, in this case Nike. \n",
    "## <font color=Blue>__Structure__</font>\n",
    "### <font color=Red>__Scaper.py:__</font>\n",
    "This is where I create the __ClothingItem__ class, which stores the name, description,price, and link to its image, as well as a method that prints all of this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also where I create the __SearchObj__ class, which initializes an instance of *chromedriver* for the user's particular operating system, then has two methods for the majority of webscraping, __find_items__, and __search__:\n",
    "#### <font color=Blue>__find_items:__</font>\n",
    "This method takes the input of an html document converted to a string, as well as a list of images both supplied from the search method.\n",
    "Then, using normal text parsing as well as knowledge of how Nike sets up their website, creates and returns a list of the Clothing Items for each particular search.\n",
    "#### <font color=Blue>__search:__</font>\n",
    "This method takes the input of the string you are searching for, as well as a string denoting which company you want to search for, which will always be Nike for the purposes of this project. In the method, it uses _Beautiful Soup_ to parse the link created with simple string concatenation for a particular search of Nike's website, and stores the html to a string. Then it uses _Selenium_ along with _chromedriver_ to retreive all of the images from the site, and passes this on to the __find_items__ method.\n",
    "### <font color=Red>__UserData.py:__</font>\n",
    "This is where I create the __User__ class, which stores the preferences of each user in a series of dictionaries and arrays, giving a place to store preferences for item types (shirts/shorts/socks), item colors, and prices, as well as a set of preferences per each type of item.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __User__ class has methods __add_pref__, __get_pref__, __get_recom_items__, and __get_recom_perItem__:\n",
    "#### <font color=Blue>__add_pref__</font>\n",
    "This method adds or updates the user's preferences, taking inputs of the preference itself, (*ie: blue*), as well as the preference type (*ie: color*), and an optional input of the item type, so that a preference could be added to only a specific type of item.\n",
    "#### <font color=Blue>__get_pref__</font>\n",
    "This method prints out whatever is held for a specific preference in the user's data.\n",
    "#### <font color=Blue>__get_recom_items__</font>\n",
    "This method loops through the user's generic (*non-item specific*) preferences and generates different search keywords to be run through the search method in __Scraper.py__ to print out the info from each item as well as display their image.\n",
    "#### <font color=Blue>__get_recom_perItem__</font>\n",
    "This method loops through the user's per-item specific preferences and generates different search keywords to be run through the search method in __Scraper.py__ to print out the info from each item as well as display their image.\n",
    "### <font color=Red>__Tests.py__</font>\n",
    "This holds the tests to be run for project evaluation, and can be run via the following code cell:"
